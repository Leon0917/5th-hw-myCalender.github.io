## My day planner to help facilitate a smooth transiton throughout the day

We created a calendar to organize a work day schedule from 9:00AM through to 5:00PM that said day. HTML, CSS as well as Jquery was used to create this day planner, moment.js was used to for time formating. In this planner, the user will have the option of entering activities in the text area provided for each hour, after which they will be able to click the saved button which will save their activities on a local storage.
